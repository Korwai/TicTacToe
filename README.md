# TicTacToe
Second attempt at a side project during Fall 2019/Winter 2020. This project is a recreation of a previous attempt I did of TicTacToe. While the previous one outputs purely to console, this one incorporates the Java Swing library and thus, is played on a GUI. It currently works but at the moment, there are still bugs and features I wish to add.

Known Bugs
- The Text Region above doesn't say who won unless you click on a button one more time after a win.

Potential Future Features
- A red bar that indicates the winning line.
- A menu screen that starts the game.
- A replay button that restarts the game without needing to exit and run again.
- An option to play against an AI.
