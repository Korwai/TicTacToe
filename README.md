# TicTacToe
Second attempt at a side project during Fall 2019/Winter 2020. It currently works but at the moment, there are still bugs and features I wish to add.

Bugs
-The Text Region above doesn't say who won unless you click on a button one more time after a win.

Potential Future Features
-A red bar that indicates the winning line.

-A menu screen that starts the game.

-A replay button that restarts the game without needing to exit and run again.

-An option to play against an AI.
